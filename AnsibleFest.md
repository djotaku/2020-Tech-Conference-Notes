## Keynote: Collaborating at Scale: Connecting the growing ansible community through innovation and change

Part of Ansible's success being built on a modular architecture which made it easier to get started, use, and contribute. 

Now things have grown. How can they continue to have contributors? They've modularized even more via Collections. (important as any project grows)

In Ansible 2.10 (batteries still included - but optional (via collections))

## Adapting to change with automation

Ansible collections plus OpenShift help make it work better across clouds

## CarMax: Driving Efficiency and Innovation with Ansible

### People

What do you need to do to get buy-in? Are your people trained well? 

Good thing about the way Ansible playbooks are written, it's got a very low learning curve. It's written more like English than bash or Powershell Scripts.

They can help to speed up adoption of automation.

### Processes

How well are your processes documented? 

What processes does your org have in place?

### Technology

How will success be measured?

### DevOps

This allows the devs not to have to worry about the environments being set up correctly.
